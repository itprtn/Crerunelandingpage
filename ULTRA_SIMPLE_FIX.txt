YOUR ERRORS ARE NORMAL - HERE'S THE FIX
========================================

ERRORS YOU SAW:
❌ 401 /settings
❌ 401 /leads  
❌ 500 /leads

WHY?
Because the database tables don't exist yet!

THE FIX (5 MINUTES):
==================

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   → Select project: gfedfklnzkgifpdxrybh

2. Click: SQL Editor (left sidebar)

3. Click: New Query (blue button)

4. Open file: /scripts/01-init-supabase-FINAL.sql
   Copy ALL content

5. Paste into SQL Editor

6. Click: Run (blue button)

7. Refresh browser (F5)

DONE! ✓ Errors are gone!

========================================

WHAT HAPPENS THEN:

Before SQL:  ❌ Tables don't exist
After SQL:   ✓ 7 tables created
             ✓ 14 security policies added
             ✓ 13 indexes created
             ✓ App can save leads!

TEST IT:
1. Go to localhost:5173
